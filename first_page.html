        For many people working in the manga industry, the fact that Goodnight Punpun were in the list of best-selling manga in 2016 is always a surprise. In the list, among all stories that feature grand, ambitious adventure of young heroes, Goodnight Punpun, a depressing never-ending life story of an ordinary boy seem to be an alien.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondpara open paragraph">
      <p>
However, in manga fandom, the title’s success is predictable. There was a cult following Goodnight Punpun years before it got licensed in English due to a translation of a fan known by his alias as Hox. In fact, Goodnight Punpun could not have been published if it had not been for Hox’s translation.  “You just don’t jump into a 13-volume long series that finished serialization in Japan unless you’re sure there’s a readership that will actually buy it” – said Hox.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="thirdpara open paragraph">
      <p>
        People like Hox are called scanlators, the ones who scan, translate manga from Japanese to other languages, and distribute them on the internet for free, illegally without any consent of publishers or authors. However, they “have a role to play, to bring innovation to manga repertoire” – said Matteo Fabbretti, a researcher who studied manga fan translation at Ritsumeikan University, Japan.

        The invisible factory

    </div>
    <div class="fourthpara body paragraph">
      <p>
        Even if you are an avid manga reader, you probably could not imagine scanlation community is a huge factory until you become a part of it. “Releasing a chapter is a tremendous amount of works” – said Das immediately about what he learned from being a scanlator. Das is one of “raw” providers who are in charge of the first step of the scanlation’s factory line, provides untranslated manga pages for scanlators. He codes his own programs to rip the highest possible quality digital pages from Japanese manga publishers’ reader sites.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fifthpara body paragraph">
      <p>
        Scanlators often work in group. A group can be a one-man-band like Hox or more-than-ten-people organization in which each person is responsible for a step in scanlation process. After receiving the raw from raw providers like Das, people who were assigned as cleaner or re-drawer will using image editing software to remove all the Japanese text of the pages. It could take them hours or even days to erase the text outside the speech bubbles and then redraw the missing art in a single page. After getting the translation from translators and clean pages of re-drawers, a typesetter whose job is similar to a typographer who meticulously choose the right fonts, size and style of the texts that are both readable and best convey the characters’ emotion, to put the translation on the clean pages. For final steps, an editor and a quality checker will review the group’s work before publishing it on the internet. The scanlation group’s workflow is similar to professional publisher’s one except for the fact that scanlators do all of the hard works for free. Most of scanlators I talked to spend almost all of their free time beside their day job or study to work on scanlations. Some even sleep less than five hours per day to help out several groups at once.

              <p> Digital published raws, although are convenient, “are what they are for better or for worst” quality. So, there are scanlation groups still prefer the “traditional way” of getting the raws by scanning from the printed copies to have the best control of quality of the works that they put out for the readers. Also, “the important part for me in buying the books is, despite doing an activity that is illegal, I am able to help the author in a small way” – said GGpx, head of Illuminati-manga, one of oldest scanlation groups.</p>
<p> Scanning takes lots of time and efforts. Firstly, scanlators have to pay up to ten times of the books’ price to import them from Japan. Secondly, they have to de-bind the book to scan page by page. Last but not least, since the scanned pages are grey, have the dust comes from the paper and curved edges, scanlators have to use a photo-editing software to fix to make the pages look pristine and flat.</p>

              <p>One of features that makes reading manga is like cinematic experience is the sound effects (SFXs) and large texts which are mostly hand-drawn on pages. To erase Japanese SFXs, texts and replace them by English ones is extremely time-consuming and detail-oriented. Kal, a nearly-20-year-experienced scanlator refer good re-drawers to “beasts” and “artists”. </p>
              <p>“Taking hours isn’t long, taking days for a page is long” – said Motokare, a one-man-band scanlator group. Scanlators not only have to re-create those texts in English to “preserve” the cinematic touch of the scene but also have to draw the missing arts caused by erasing Japanese texts. Although not all of re-drawers know how to draw, they know how to use content-aware-fill brush and other “tricks” in Photoshop so skillfully that make the redrawn pages look seamlessly. </p>

              “People think that typesetting/lettering is easy, but think of it this way: Putting text in a speech bubble is putting on a shirt. “ said GGpX, the head of Illuminati-manga, one of the oldest scanlation groups. His group declared that its works’ quality can rival any publisher. “Most people like having a shirt that fits, isn’t too tight and they have room to breathe. That’s the same with text in a bubble. The text needs to be in the middle without taking up too much space, without it feeling "claustrophobic" for lack of a better term”
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, there is more about typesetting than fitting texts in the speech bubbles. “To me, a manga is a silent movie. The text are the voices and you have to not only make sure it compliment the art and story vibe, it should also tell emotions.” said Motokare, founder of one man scanlation group. “The text should be able to tell you if they are feeling angry, frustrated, etc. Is it a loud shout, or just a shout? What kind of shout? Happy shout? Angry shout? Scary shout? Threatening shout? So, a flair/eye for fonts to represent emotions while keeping it complementary is important”.

                Quality checker is the position that scanlation groups have while publishers do not. Quality checker is the one who not only checks on the translation but also checks on the redrawing and typesetting, make sure everything on the pages looks satisfying even to the most demanding fans. “We enjoy the craft of it. It’s not just about scanlating to read, it’s more” said Velosiped, a scanlator who helps Motokare, an one man scanlation group “to be part of the creation of that magical experience”.

        Even though scanlating is labor of love and scanlators are from all over the world, scanlation process and skills have been standardized and become more evolving with time and technological development since as early as the 1970s, before any English manga publishers was founded. Scanlators even develop one-stop shop tools like manga-updates, a Wikipedia-like database to announce their new releases and MangaDex, an ad-free manga aggregator site to publish their scanlation, which make their works highly accessible to fans.

        Since 2001, there have been nearly 10 thousand of scanlation groups. More than one-fifth of those are currently active and nearly 90 of them have published a lot more than 512 titles, the number of manga that Viz Media, the oldest and biggest English manga publisher in the world has been published for 20 years. On MangaDex, the number of manga titles that were licensed is just 5% of the number of scanlated ones, which is currently around 40 thousand titles at the moment.

        Manga is a mass entertainment that has hundreds of genres which has no off-limit topic or audience. However, publishers often limit themselves in publishing shonen and shojo manga which are the genres that aimed at teen boys and teen girls respectively. To put it more precisely, among dozens of genres, publishers most prefer shonen manga which account for more than 40% of all manga titles that have been published by four main English publishers - Yen Press, SevenSeas, Viz Media, and Kodansha USA. According to Fabbretti, this was because the manga fan community was built upon an established fandom of sci-fi movies like Star Wars and Star Trek.

        Literary manga often comes from josei and seinen which are genres that aim at adult female and male respectively. However, moving to an older demographic reader is a huge challenge for the big publishers. “It’s both commercially risky and also ideologically risky. Some people may see this manga full of sex and [they go] like, what is this? Rubbish!” – said Fabbretti. He emphasized josei manga, one of the most under-representative genres which accounts for only 5% of all English manga titles published by the four biggest manga publishers in the US.

          In the US, the biggest English-language manga market, manga has been mostly sold at bookstores and displayed in the same section with children’s books. “If somebody picks this up without knowing what it is if they think it’s aimed at kids and there’s something in there that they don’t think is appropriate for kids, how do we handle that?” – said Lillian Diaz-Przybyl, a freelance manga editor and former 15-year-editor at Tokyopop which used to be one of the prominent manga publishers in the US in the 2000s.

          Even boutique publishers who only interested in high artistic manga find it hard to sell them.
“We would normally print two or three thousand copies to start, that’s all, and then rely on and hope for, pray for a reprint to come along” – said Stephen Robson, owner of FanFareUK, the publisher was known for bringing the greatest manga to the US. The signature and also best-selling manga titles of FanFareUK were of Jiro Taniguchi, a manga artist whom Mexican Oscar-winning director Guillermo Del Toro referred to as a “manga poet”. However, it took a decade or more for Taniguchi’s works to start catching on in the English language market.

          Robson runs a warehouse and this business paid for his publishing house which he admitted, is a “very expensive hobby”. Each book costs him around 10 thousand dollars to put out before any money comes back. To maintain decent cash flow, he is only able to publish up to two books each year while a scanlation group is able put out six titles on average in the same period of time.

          Since there is no money involved, scanlators just publish whatever they want. Scanlation community has introduced josei and seien manga as early as the 1970s to fans. The majority of all ever existed scanlation groups introduced at least one adult-oriented title to their readers. Nearly half of all currently active scanlation groups have at least 30% such works in their portfolio. Those groups “can see the gap in what’s available commercially and decide to take action. They are literary aware, they think they know what a popular manga is but they want to translate the opposite”. – said Fabbratti.

          Kal’s scanlation group is one of those. “We’re simply scanlating a few titles to expand readers’ definitions of what manga can be” - written on her group’s website. She carefully picks the short, old, unpopular manga that “almost get no chance to be licensed”. Her group’s portfolio includes the works of Kyo Machiko, Kasabe Tetsu, two manga artists that won prizes in Japan Media Arts Festival, an annual event that praises outstanding works in Japanese contemporary art but the works of those two has never been published in English.

          Kal took her Japanese course in college out of her love for scanlation. “By translating these stories, I get the satisfaction of a creative outlet as well as getting to read the story” – she said. She will not work on the titles that she does not feel “amazing” even she paid hundreds of dollars to import the books from Japan. Many scanlators I have interviewed empathize with Kal’s view. However, even though they want to share the series they love with the fan community, they do not mind if their works do not become popular. “I care about doing series that interest me. Whether they become popular or not literally means nothing to me” - said GGpX, founder of Illuminati-Manga, a 15-year-old group that was considered as an “elitist” in the scanlation community. They only translate seinen titles and among those were the works of Natsujikei Miyazaki and Keigo Shinzo, two young promising alternative manga artists in Japan but were little-known by the English readers.

          Scanlator’s selfish love for manga maybe the reason why they have brought so many unique, alternative works to the English-speaking world. There are nearly 3000 seinen titles and nearly 1000 josei titles which have been scanlated, compared to nearly 500 seinen titles and 100 josei titles that has been published by four biggest English manga publishers. Among 118 titles that have been published by Drawn & Quarterly, FanFareUK, Fantagraphics, and Vertical (before it was bought by Kodansha USA), the most prominent avant-garde manga publishers in the English market, 72 titles were already scanlated even before it got licensed in English. As for the 46 licensed titles that have not been scanlated, the scanlation community translated their author’s other works already. It was hard to turn a blind eye at the scanlators’ works even they are illegal. “Do people at the publishing companies never look at the scanlation sites? Probably not” – said Diaz-Przybyl.

          Scanlation community has influenced the publishers to bring more literary manga to the fans. According to Christopher Knoll, brand manager of Kaiten Books, a manga publisher that only license works of the new, un-mainstreamed artists, publishers can use the scanlation community as part of their market research, by looking at the number of views, ratings of a title on manga aggregators, how often it is discussed on social media… “If the scanlation did not exist, then they [publishers] would be, you know, firing blindly pretty much” – said Knoll.

          Every month, Seven Seas conducts a poll asking their audience to recommend titles that they want to see in English and “all these people telling you to license this sh*t as they’re reading it illegally by a scan” – said Black anon, a former scanlator now working as a professional manga translator. According to Fabbratti, My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness that won Best Manga in Harvey Award, the oldest and most prestigious award of the US comic industry would not be published by Seven Seas in 2017 without the popularity of its scanlation. This manga was written by Nagata Kabi, a little known artist in Japan that released her works on Pixiv, a social media platform for artists rather than a traditional Japanese manga magazine.

          June M. Madeley, a professor at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, has been researched manga readers and anime viewers since 2009, believes it is because of scanlators that publishers in the US have been published more and more adult-oriented manga recently. Around 30% of all titles that were published up until now now by the four biggest US manga publishers are seinen, even more than shojo manga.

          Even in cases that the publishers’ and scanlations’s same decision is purely a coincidence, scanlation’s works still help publishers to spread the words. Publishers, especially avant-garde manga publishers are always behind scanlators in making a title searchable in Google. It is scanlators’ “way of getting the name out there for a series that otherwise would never make it over to the Western or even the English speaking market” – said Garrison Denim, the president of Kaiten Books. Kaiten Books used to ask MangaDex to put their titles’ official links next to its scanlated version and their sales spiked. Robson from FanFareUK also think scanlation helps him to extend audience: “My view is, people who didn’t like what they read in the scanlation wouldn’t buy my books, if you see want I mean”

          Back to the scanlation community, they do not care how they do would affect the industry, even if it is something positive. When I asked Hox whether he is happy because Goodnight Punpun got licensed likely because of his scanlation, “I was just neutral about it. I don’t get happy if a series gets published because of me. I get happy if people like my translations/work” – he said. For him, scanlation is a life-long hobby that he does for his own satisfaction since there are so many serious, mature seinen manga never get translated out there.
