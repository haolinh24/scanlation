    In 2010, 42 Japanese and US publishers create a coalition to fight manga piracy, sending a message that they no longer approve of scanlators who are manga’s fan translators. OneManga, the first manga host for scanlators to upload and share their work announced its complete shut-down.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="open paragraph">
  <p>
    A few month later, Batoto was launched as a replacement. Batoto operated in the face of waves of take-down notices from publishers sent as part of the Manga-Anime Guardian project, another anti-piracy initiative which was supported by the Japanese government. This, however, was not why the site closed permanently in 2018.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="open paragraph">
  <p>
  The founder RawR blamed exhaustion. He had run the site alone for seven years, paying server costs through ads and occasional donations from readers. RawR had to be permanently available in case of technical problems with the site, to the point that he didn’t dare to take a day off or get a good night’s sleep. He had alarms that went off in the middle of the night if the site went down.
</p>
</div>
<div class="open paragraph">
  <p>
    It was not the end of sites made by scanlators, for scanlators. MangaDex was created a few days later. Hundreds of enthusiastic fans helped to transfer millions of manga pages from Batoto to MangaDex over the course of a year. MangaDex is ad-free and currently the most respected manga aggregator in the scanlation community, with 12 million unique visitors monthly.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="open paragraph">
  <p>
    The birth and death of scanlation aggregators which are sites that host of scanlation like these is the best representation of how this community operates. It is similar to a relay race in which if one site go down, there will be another one to succeed it. “Trying to get into a legal battle with an aggregator like us that’s making no money is a colossal waste of money, and effort with no benefit since another site like ours will pop up to replace us if we die” says Plykiya, the person in charge of MangaDex’s public relations.

    The biggest threat to a scanlation group’s existence is not the take-down notices from publishers but the wavering motivation of its members. Most scanlators stop doing this work, which requires a huge amount of time and dedication, when they graduate from university, get a job or start a family. “They don’t say ‘goodbye’, or ‘I’m done’, or really anything. You try to contact them and you never hear back. Kind of like a relationship”, says GGpX, the head of the 15-year-old-scanlation group Illuminati-manga.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Scanlation groups are always on the verge of abandoning projects or disbanding because their ‘staff’ suddenly leaves. But they survive by constantly recruiting new liked-minded members. You see how fiercely groups advertise their vacancies by looking at their scanlations. Whenever they release a new chapter, the first or last page of scanlation will always be a recruitment page in manga style.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    On average, a scanlator group lasts for a year and a half and works on nine series, which is nearly double the amount of work that FanFareUK, a boutique publisher that is known for bringing the best manga to the US, does in the same period of time. When a group is defunct, it leaves behind many uncompleted projects. However, it is usually the case that new groups are born because someone gets interested in picking up and continuing those projects. “[It’s] rare to find a group that only works on stuff from scratch” – said Mag, a member of countless scanlation groups and a founder of the Quicksands Scanlation group which focuses on scanlating niche, old, adult-oriented titles that were left aside by others.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    If the scanlators are motivated, warnings from publishers are not an issue. DMCA takedown notices which account for the majority of those warnings are sent to websites’ hosts and other internet service providers. It “doesn’t mean the scanlator willingly takes stuff down. And those who want to continue often still do. It is the Hydra. Cut down one head and two more sprout”, says Mag. The scanlators just simply move their website to different hosts which US or Japanese law cannot reach. Some might drop their old name and work under another that publishers will find it hard to locate, but their fans will follow them along.

    Before the launch of Discord in 2015, scanlators communicate with each others and readers through Internet Relay Chat which not allow them to share pictures. "IRC isn't a good platform to teach people how to do things in Photoshop. Being able to screen share is wild", says Plykiya. "The number of people coming into scanlation, being taught how to do it, etc is all just rising higher than it ever has before".

    Enthusiastic manga fans often act as a shield for scanlators. Even though publishers who publish “boys’ love” manga, a sub-genre that focuses on intimate relationships between male characters, are notorious for chasing down scanlators who translate their work, the scanlators still manage to work underground. They bury their work deeper and deeper in Discord channels, Tumblr or forums, which are out of publishers’ sight. “Boys’ love readers are surprisingly faithful and loyal. So when a group says ‘don’t share’, they don’t share. The works are translated and distributed in a very small exclusive circle. That’s how it stays underground” , says Motokare, the founder of one-man group  that has the same name who used to translate boys’ love titles. She has received three take-down notices by email from boys’ love publishers. Fans do not mind if they have to go the extra mile to donate to the sites that they love. They are willing to buy Bitcoin to maintain the site they love if it is the only way of donating that site accepts. MangaDex always receive a thousand dollar worth of Bitcoin from its fans per month to pay its server cost.

  Scanlators’ upper hand
</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    What motivates scanlators? Why do they persist? The short answer is that publishers aren’t satisfying their readers. Hye-Kyung Lee, of King’s College London, was one of the first people in the UK to study scanlation. Lee has found that the scanlation community has an advantage over publishers in publishing manga more quickly, accessibly, in greater numbers and sometimes even in better quality.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Manga is published in Japanese by chapter weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Not until there are enough chapters, are they published as a physical book. And for that book to be published in English, it will take another six to nine month to go through licensing and sales process. “That’s just how physical publishing works in the US, it sucks” says Lillian Diaz-Przybyl, the former editor of TokyoPop, a prominent manga publisher in the US in the 2000s.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    It would be torture for fans to wait that long for their favorite titles if they have other options. Since scanlators are based all over the world, with no time-zone limitation, they seem to work non-stop. They are able to translate a title right after its new chapter comes out in a magazine in Japan, if not on the same day or even earlier since they got the untranslated manga leaked by Japanese bookstores that do not follow the publishers’ embargo.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>    Also, scanlators always very up-to-date with not only manga titles that have been published in dozens of reputational manga magazine but also manga titles that are trendy that only god knows when it would be released officially since they are published in social media platforms. Thus, scanlators introduced to readers manga at a great variety of artistic and storytelling styles. Lots of scanlators are either Japanese or have lived in Japan for a long time. They have a good understanding of Japanese culture and they provide cultural references in their translation which “readers appreciate a lot”, according to Lee.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    With instructions and guides available on manga forums and YouTube, anyone can learn the basic scanlating skills and improve over time and through groups they have joined. The scanlation community is a big world where everyone can find their place. Whether they are a raw provider who provides digital untranslated manga pages, a scanner who imports, de-binds and scans the book, a translator, a cleaner who gets the Japanese text out of the speech bubble and re-draws the erased patterns to make the picture looks seamless, the typesetter who put the translated text on the page, an editor, a proof-reader, software developer or web developer, their skills and talents are all treasured. Their alias is credited in every scanlation that they take part in. Even though readers are tolerant of all kind of scanlation quality, some groups’ work can rival top English-language manga publishers and they test newcomers rigorously. Velospied, an experienced re-drawer, who once won the gold medal in the most prestigious art competition in her country has failed twice when applying to a DeathTool Scanlation group.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    The scanlation community’s influence on the manga fan is so significant that it has even made publishers change their practice. Ten years ago, scanlators had pushed the publishers not to localize manga in line with what they thought Americans understood. They were opposed to removing honorifics in conversation or “replacing” Japanese items like onigiri (rice balls wrapped in dried seaweed) with with American equivalents like donuts or ramen with spaghetti.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    In fact, the scanlation community is the where lots of professional manga translators, typesetters and editors have come from. “When I joined the industry 15 years ago, you know there were a lot of people who were good at their jobs because they had a background in working in scanlation”, says Diaz-Przybyl. Two of her former colleagues at TokyoPop founded Toriyama’s world, one of the largest scanlation group in the 2000s.

  Unfairly matched competition
</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    It is not that the publisher does not try to publish more quickly, in greater quality and with better prices than the scanlators. More than one fifth of titles published by the four biggest English manga publishers – Viz Media, Kodansha USA, Yen Press and Seven Seas — are digital, which means those titles came out at least twice as fast as if they had been published in hard copies. Viz Media has even managed to publish Weekly Shonen Jump, the most beloved manga magazine in the world in English on the same day as its release in Japan. Kodansha USA too published 20 titles in a similar way but on different platforms. In 2019, Shueisha, the owner of Viz Media even went further and launched an app called MangaPlus which allows readers to read latest chapters of 55 titles for free.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    At the moment, Viz Media and Kodansha USA are able to publish around 200 chapters monthly on the same day as Japan. If we compare that with more than 160 chapters that scanlation factories publish daily, the publishers’ efforts are still not enough. Not to mention that those simultaneously published titles were mostly aimed at teenagers and you have to pay for at least two services to read them or you cannot read them at all because those platfoms are geo-blocked in certain countries. As for digital manga, the cost was not much cheaper than hard copies which were sold as collectible items. If the titles have more than 40 volumes, like most of those in Weekly Shonen Jump, it can cost readers a fortune as one volume is around 20 dollars.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    In the eyes of hard-core manga fans the scanlation community is still their dreamland, with a tremendous amount of titles in every possible manga genre that and are in one place for them to read, follow and download for free, from anywhere. Publishers cannot compete.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    However, the scanlation community says it has no intention of competing with the industry, let alone sabotaging it. “I don’t know of any scanlator who are circumventing the industry. They’re not trying to wreck things.” says Professor June M. Madeley, University of New Brunswick, Canada who has studied about manga readers since 2009. According to Madeley, scanlators are unlike other kinds of popular culture pirates who copy or distribute movie, music, books because they care a lot about the industry, especially the artists who have worked very hard, constantly under pressure of their titles getting axed if nobody buys them.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Scanlators’ ethic is to stop scanlating a series once it was officially licensed in English. Whenever I visit scanlation groups’ Discord channel, website, forum or read scanlation, scanlators keep telling their readers to buy manga, not only the translated version but also the Japanese one if the series has not yet licensed to support the artists. It is common for scanlators to pay 40 – 60 dollars to import just an eight-dollar-magazine either for their scanlation or their collection purposes.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Not only scanlators but also regular fans are highly aware of that ethical principles and they spend money whenever they can, according to Madeley. “Even though they read those scans for free, they will buy [the titles] when they finally get published in a paper book. If they don’t do that then they’ll buy plushies and posters and whatever licensed things are.”
  </p>
</div>
<h3 class="paragraph subtitle">
  You cannot tell fans to stop
</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    When writing those series of article, I have reached out to dozens of editors who are working in either boutique or big manga publishers but they either did not replied, agreed to talk to me and then had a second thought about it or expalained that they cannot say anything no matter how much they want to help. Scanlation is so much of a taboo that they either do not want or refuse to open up about the influence of the pirate community on the manga industry.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    If it had not been for the scanlators, the manga foreign market would not have existed in the first place. Most of the time when publishers explore a new market, the scanlator army has already paved the way for them. Back in 2005, when US society are hesitant to talk about to gays’ right, let alone sexual content that features gay people in comics, TokyoPop was confident enough to create an imprint for the boy’s love genre partly because “there were scanlation out there who are definitely doing it, who got lots of attention” – said Diaz-Przybyl.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    How the boys’ love manga genre took off in English-speaking markets shows how much the industry benefits from fans. “[Boys’ love] would be an area that probably did come out of scanlation first because there was a pretty big online community for it very early on” – said Shaenon Garrity, a freelance manga editor and comic market counselor for the past 20 years. According to Garrity, a boys’ love fan community has existed since the 1980s, well before any manga was published in English. By 2001, despite the fact that the market for boys’ love content didn’t even exist, Yaoi-con, the first festival for boys’ love fan was held in California, with around 450 people.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Garrity remembers fans’ reaction when the first official release of boys’ love manga happened: “everybody’s like whoaaaaaaaaaaa finally, we can finally see Fake!” Fake is a classic  boys’ love manga which features a relationship between two policemen in New York. It was published by TokyoPop in 2004. Today boys’ love, a niche sub-genres in hundreds of manga genres, has become mainstream. The number of boys’ love titles is almost equal to all manga titles aimed at teenagers, which is manga’s target audience in English-speaking markets.  Nowadays almost all publishers, even Viz Media which does not produce adult, erotica manga, publishes boys love titles or creates a separate imprint for this sub-genre.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    To think of scanlation as either free marketing or copyright infringement is too simple. “It can be something else, an essential part of fandom. I think the manga fandom beyond Japan is kind of rooted in scanlation. You can’t really separate this, telling that this is a copyright infringement, this should be stopped. You cannot tell this to the fan”, says Lee. Madeley even believes that scanlators who are also hard-core, enthusiastic manga fans themselves have the  power to “convert” freeriders who just love to read manga for free.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    As Madeley put it, publishers should give fans more of what they want or “leave them alone”. Trying to suppress the scanlators could cost publishers money. In 2010, Libre Shuppan, the biggest boys’ love manga publisher in Japan sent Cease & Desist letters to big boys’ love scanlation groups, telling them either to remove all of their translation or to risk legal action. Seeing their favorite groups being ‘shot down’ one by one, a fan sent a frustrated email to Libre Shuppan and called on others to boycott all books either published by or licensed from this publisher.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    “Making them [scanlators] afraid of your lawyers, that’s not going to help you make money. Those people might decide: ‘what’s the heck with you, I’m not going to spend money on this anymore because you’re so mean and aggressive’ and they might tell other people because fans can talk in places where no one can catch them”, says Madeley.
