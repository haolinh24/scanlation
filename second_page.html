    No matter how much publishers could take the suggestions from the scanlation community – the huge operation of enthusiastic fans that scan, translate, edit manga and put them on the internet for free, they still see this community as an enemy. Even though most of scanlated titles are unlicensed in English, scanlators do not make money from their works and there is no clear evidence that the scanlation directly causes the publishers’ sales loss, publishers still have the one legitimate reason to fight the scanlators: copyright infringement. “It is more of an American kind of corporate culture that you own that stuff and no one else should circulate it. If it circulates, you need to make money” – said Professor June M. Madeley, University of New Brunswick, Canada who has studied conflicts between the manga industry and scanlators.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="open paragraph">
  <p>
    The tension of publishers rise as fans’ access to manga is dominated by scanlation, according to Hye-Kyung Lee, King’s College London, one of the first people researched about scalation community. Before 2005, scanlators’ works were distributed secretly on their websites and their IRC channels then there came manga aggregators. Except for the non-profit ones run by scanlators, aggregators are scrape all scanlators’ works from their website without consent and host them in a portal and make money off advertisements from a traffic of dozen millions new visitors per month.  “Once those aggregators were just putting so much content and making it so easy to find, that was really a problem” – said Professor June M. Madeley, University of New Brunswick, Canada who has studied about manga readers since 2009.

<h3 class="subtitle paragraph">The battle began</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Nowadays, aggregators has sprung as fast as mushroom and publishers have been trying in vain to take down those sites. One thing they do every day is sending requests to delist manga aggregator sites and their clones from Google search, to make it at least less accessible by fans. According to my analysis from Google transparency report, VIZ Media, the biggest manga publishing in English-speaking market on average has sent nearly 30 thousand URLs that they want to delist per day this year. In 2016, this number is nearly 150 thousand. The total number of URLs sent by Viz Media alone since 2003 accounts for around 4% of all URLs has ever been sent to Google, which makes Viz Media is a top 5 copyright holders sending delisting requests in the world.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="caption chart paragraph">
  <p>
    Number of requests sent to Google by three out of four biggest English manga publishers to delist the hosts of manga scanlation from 2003 to 2020. The only publisher who do not sent any request is Seven Seas, which make it "the most scanlator-friendly" publisher.
  </p>
</div>
<div id="container" class="svg-container"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Publishers have been official in the battle with the scanlators for more than a decade. In 2010, 42 publishers from Japan and the US formed a coalition against scanlators, especially aggregators. They vowed to “seek injunctive relief and statutory damages” and reported those sites to “federal authorities, including the anti-piracy units of the Justice Department, local law enforcement agencies and FPI”. In 2013, this coalition was followed by the Manga-Anime Guardians project, which was announced by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). Behind the Manga-Anime Guardians project was the 16 biggest manga publishers and Japanese anime studios which produce animations of manga that aimed to take down 580 manga and anime hosts. METI claimed that the piracy cost the manga and anime industry $20 billion worldwide.
  </p>
</div>
<div class='paragraph'>
<p>
  At the moment, these initiatives are inactive but publishers has not yet given up on taking down either non-profit or for-profit aggregators. Both Japanese and American publishers have been separately but persistently sending DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notice to the aggregators’ hosts or internet service providers (ISP) to asked for their content on those sites be removed. More aggressively, lawyers from those publishers emailed C&D (Cease & Desist) letter to the aggregators’ owners, which means if the owners did not comply with the removal requests, they will be sued.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
  However, aggregators are no longer been the only the targets of DMCA notices or C&D letters, scanlation groups have, too. “It’s always been low-key common” – said mag about the legal practices of the publisher. Mag is a founder of Quicksands scanlation group and also a member of countless other ones. Understandably, among groups who received copyright infringement notices are those that scanlate licensed manga, especially the money-making titles for the publishers. However, even groups that translated unlicensed titles also get DMCA notices and C&D letters. According to mag, yaoi and hentai publishers are the most DMCA “happy” ones. Yaoi or boy’s love as a broader term is a manga sub-genre that features the intimate relationship between male characters and hentai is erotic manga. Both of those sub-genres got a loyal fan base in the English-speaking market. Libre Shuppan, one of the biggest and most notorious yaoi manga publishers for being harsh to the scanlators. “They come after you if you even dare to think about translating it” – said motokare, a five-year-experienced scanlator and have encountered problems three times with yaoi publishers and one of them is Libre.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    But then, once in a while, there are groups that do not fall into any above categories, got their blog ‘nuked’ or their posts ‘disappeared’. “Under normal circumstance, publishers wouldn’t come after me because I’m not affecting them, but if they read about it directly…sometimes things happen” - said Kal, a 20-year-experienced scanlator. Even though Kal has never had any problem with any publisher and only two of more than one hundred titles that her group has worked on got licensed long after they scanlated them, she told me to not to either mention her nickname in the scanlation community or her current group’s name in my article.

    Almost all of aggregators’ existence is beyond the control of the scanlators but publishers argue that if it had not been for scanlators, aggregators would have not existed in the first place. Seeing everyone reading scanlation, especially if readers “just like, woohoo, free things!” as Mandeley put it, people working in the manga industry feel it unbearable. It was the last straw to so many problems that they has endured. The manga sale is incredibly unpredictable. The manga artists in Japan have been working to death to catch up with ridiculous deadlines. The majority of translators, typesetters, editors in the US work as freelancers with modest pay and often got fewer credits than they deserve. Readers only know who is the translator, typesetter, or editor of the series once they bought the book and diligently look for their names on the last page. Translators’ or typesetters’ names never appear on the publisher’s website or Amazon book’s detail, though.

    People often refer to scanlation work as “labor of love” but “It’s still a labor of love in the industry…It is so incredibly real, I mean I make a living off of it but not all translators are as fortunate and you know, it might not be as possible for me if I wasn’t living with a partner” – said Jenny McKeon, the translator of Blank Canvas: My so-called artist’s journey which was displayed in Manga Exhibition at British Museum in 2019. According to McKeon, the translators do not work directly with publishers but through agencies, they received only half of her paycheck.

    McKeon has been so frustrated to tell people to put an official link rather than a scanlation link when recommending a manga series on Twitter. “I think it doesn’t even occur to people that linking to a scanlation is kind of the opposite of supporting the artist” – said McKeon. Since the manga aggregators know so well how to work on search engine optimization, whenever anyone searches a series on Google, the official translation link of that series almost always appears below several aggregators’ link.

    People can get very personal when it is the series they are working on and have very high hope for but got very low sell. Lillian Diaz-Przybyl, a former editor of TokyoPop, one of the English-language market’s pioneer and most prolific manga publishers in the 2000s, started our conversation with a disclaimer “I don’t want to throw scanlation under the bus …” Back in 2007, she is the editor behind Gakuen Alice which TokyoPop believed would be the successor of Fruit Basket, their all-time best-selling manga. As much as expectation and investment for it, Gakuen Alice sold terribly, even less than one-tenth of Fruit Basket with only 4000 copies at peak per title, according to Diaz-Przybyl. At the same time, the scanlation of Gakuen Alice was in top five most-read titles on MangaFox, one of the most manga aggregators at that time with four million hits per month although it was shoddily done and poorly translated compare to the official release. “It undermines the values of professionals like me who, you know, have spent a decade and a half doing this and none of us are making a ton of money doing this”. – said Diaz-Przybyl. After that incident, Diaz-Przyby felt all the argument on the basis of scanlation to be either “disingenuous” or rather “naïve”. “That idea of scanlation helps the awareness of the series? Yeah, but that doesn’t do any good if you are not going to actually buy the content and support the creator that way”. - She said. Even though she admitted that she still looks at the scanlation, she could not support “scanlation as a concept” any more.

  Among around 1.5 thousand the titles that were licensed by the four biggest manga publishers in the US, 36 titles were dropped possibly because of the bad sales. Even though all of 36 titles were scanlated, is it the scanlator’s fault? Both Lee and Mandeley emphasized many times to me that there was no evidence to say that but publishers often think scanlators should take a part of the blame. “If there’s like a lot of scanlation viewership, it might be hard to sell the official title when it comes out so you know, that could be a problem” – said Shaenon Garrity, 20-year-freelance manga editor and comic market consultant even though she also believes if a title getting a lot of attention in the fan community through scanlation, it might encourages publisher to pick it up.

  Not all titles published by four biggest English manga publishers (Viz Media, Seven Seas, Kodansha USA and Yen Press) were scanlated before official released.

    “The majority of scanlators have zero interest in going legit. Too much red tape” – said mag. However, for the minority of those who want to come clean, they were almost not welcome if they do not bury their past in deep.
  </p>

    “It was definitely more of a hindrance than help being open to it” – said AnonBlack. Right before graduating her master’s degree in translation at Kent State University in 2014, she tried to apply for an internship in anime studios and manga publishers. Since having no prior experience, she mentioned her time being a scanlator in her resume, which caused her “quite a lot of backlash”. “I was straight up rejected from Funimation (one of two biggest anime streaming service in the US) because I included on it, to the point where they wanted me to sign a waiver saying that if they discovered I was still engaging in illegal activities after I was hired that they would like to prosecute me kind of thing…” – she said. Also, the editor from the manga publisher that she applied next even went to Twitter talked about her as “thieves don’t even being sneaky anymore”.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Two years after she finally set her foot in the industry, her past still haunted AnonBlack when she was recruited by Funimation again. She told me “I had to repeatedly state over the course of a good six to eight weeks like, no I don’t do that [scanlation] anymore, I condemn it, you know, regardless how I feel about it”.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    AnonBlack’s story is nothing uncommon. “In most cases, putting that you’ve done scanlation work is more of a negative than anything and they might even blacklist you depending on the company” – said Garrison Denim, founder of KaitenBook, a nascent publisher and has been worked as a translator for several manga publishers.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

    Two success stories about how fan translation became legit that often be told in the media are Crunchyroll and Fakku. Crunchyroll started out as a fansubbing site where fans upload anime with their translated subtitles now became the most popular anime streaming and manga reading platform and Fakku turned from a hentai scanlation group to the first hentai digital publisher in the English-speaking market. However, it is not like any scanlator can follow Crunchyroll and Fakku’s steps. “People who do that are rare and the majority who do are pretty dumb about it. It’s very rare you have a Crunchyroll-like situation, or Fakku” – said Mag.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    In 2009, the same year Crunchyroll reached out to Japanese publishers to become legitimate, another site also did the same. That site is MangaHelpers, the most successful and popular hub for sharing scanlating skills, exchange raws, uploading scanlation among scanlators with 100 thousand visitors per day at that time. That site’s founders, Taylor Matthews, an American who had lived more than a decade in Japan, and Christopher Carter, a Norwegian software developer in France decided to contact Viz Media. The reason behind this decision was that fans rather read scanlation of their favorite series on the same day it was released in Japan than waiting 18 months at minimum for the English official release. “It sucked that the official channels just couldn’t get their asses in gear and make the manga available to the hundreds of thousands of people internationally” - said Carter.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Matthews and Carter were able to meet face-to-face with Shueisha, the owner of Viz Media. After 11 years, Carter is still able to recall that meeting with 15 older Japanese men, primarily in the marketing and legal department of one of the biggest Japanese manga publishers: “The marketing people, they appreciated us for the amount of free marketing that scanlation actually provides to publishers internationally. The legal people, they absolutely hated us and I am sure we would have been arrested after the meeting”
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    In the end, Shueisha rejected to work with MangaHelpers. Not once. But twice. Shueisha asked MangaHelpers to take off everything on their website and said they did not want to work with pirates. Mathews and Carter complied with Shueisha’s request and create a completely different site called Open Manga whose name was the hybrid of open source and manga. But because they advertised Open Manga on MangaHelpers, Open Manga was still considered as “piracy-related”.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    That incident not only brings nothing to MangaHelpers but also took three fourth of visitors to this site per day since all the raws and scanlations were removed. A part of the scanlation community also turned their backs at the site, blamed MangaHelpers for intending to sell scanlators.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    I asked Matthews if he had ever felt betrayed by Shueisha. To my surprise, he said no and he even felt grateful that Shueisha did not take any form of legal action. “I’d rather count my blessings than focus on any negative aspects. It was all a learning experience and everything I have learned from there has helped propel me forward” – said Matthews.
